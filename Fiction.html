                <p>Teetering towards being terribly overwrought, we didn’t love this book, but if you enjoy light historical fiction and want a beach read for a lazy trip to Thailand, or a breezy read for your long-haul flight there, this could fit the bill.
                The modern-day story centres around Julia Forrester, who grew up visiting an estate where her grandfather worked as a gardener, and was a particular expert in orchids. Recovering from a family tragedy in France, she meets Kit Crawford, the heir to the estate. The estate has fallen on hard times and he’s looking to sell. A diary uncovered here leads to the unravelling of a story featuring family secrets stretching back to the end of World War II. Involving an earlier heir to the estate’s affair with a Thai woman working at The Oriental hotel, the historical story shifts to Bangkok and briefly Ko Chang (with a train trip that we don’t think ever existed...)</p>                  </div>
